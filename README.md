Documentation for the Python code

	Introduction:
This Python code creates a Telegram bot that facilitates user interaction with a web-based quiz game. The bot allows users to start the game, provides game information, and stores user data in a PostgreSQL database.

	Key Components:
1. Telegram Bot Setup:
   - A Telegram bot is configured with a unique API token (`BOT_TOKEN`) to enable communication with users.

2. Web Game Integration:
   - A pre-defined URL (`WEB_GAME_URL`) is set for the web-based quiz game, which users can access to play the game.

3. Database Configuration:
   - PostgreSQL database details are specified (host, port, database name, username, password) for storing user data.

4. Conversation States:
   - Three conversation states (`START`, `PLAYING`, and `END`) are defined to manage user interactions and game progress.

5. User Session Management:
   - User sessions and session IDs are tracked using a dictionary (`user_sessions`). A new session ID is generated for each user.

6. Telegram Bot Commands:
   - The bot responds to the following commands:
•	`/startgame`: Initializes the game, generates a session ID, and stores user data in the database.
•	`/game`: Starts the game and provides a "Play" button linking to the web game.
•	`/info`: Provides information about the quiz game.

7. Callback Handling:
   - A callback handler (`handle_callback`) processes user callback data, allowing the transmission of user data to the web app via an HTTP request.

8. Storing User Data:
   - The `store_user_data` function is used to save user data, including user ID, username, score, and session ID, to a PostgreSQL database.

9. Flask Server Endpoint:
   - An endpoint (`/receive-score`) is available for receiving POST requests containing player scores. This functionality is useful for processing and storing user scores from the web game.

10. Main Function:
    - The `main` function initializes the Telegram bot using the ApplicationBuilder. It sets up command handlers and runs the bot until it is manually terminated.

	Customization:
   - To use this code, customize the following elements:
     - Replace `BOT_TOKEN` with your Telegram Bot Token.
     - Set the `WEB_GAME_URL` to the URL of your web-based quiz game.
     - Configure the database details (host, port, database name, username, password) as per your PostgreSQL setup.
     - Implement any additional functionality in your web-based quiz game.

Documentation for the HTML code

Introduction:
This HTML code creates a web page for a Trivia Quiz Game. The page allows users to play the quiz, view questions, and receive feedback. It also displays user session information and provides a celebratory visual effect for a perfect score.

Key Components:
1. HTML Structure:
   - The HTML document provides the necessary structure, character encoding, and viewport settings.

2. Page Title and Styling:
   - The page is titled "Trivia Quiz Game," and an external CSS stylesheet ("quiz.css") is linked to apply styles.

3. Page Content:
	The main content is contained within a "quiz-container" element.
	A logo image ("aiqem__logo.svg") is positioned in the top-left corner.
	The game title, "AiQEM Quiz," is displayed as a heading (h1).
	Quiz questions are presented within a paragraph with the id "question."
	User answer options are dynamically inserted into a div with the id "options."
	The "Next" button (id "next-btn") allows users to proceed to the next question.
	The quiz result is shown in a hidden paragraph with the id "result."
	The player's score is indicated with a paragraph displaying "Score: 0."
	A div with the id "session-id" displays the session ID.
	Additional div elements are reserved for visual effects, such as fireworks and balloons.

4. JavaScript Integration:
   - Two JavaScript scripts are incorporated:
     - "quiz.js" manages the game logic and interactivity.
     - A script block processes URL query parameters to capture user session information and displays the session ID on the page.

	Customization:
     - To utilize this code effectively, consider the following customizations:
     - Adapt "quiz.js" to include your quiz questions and game logic.
     - Customize the appearance of the page through the "quiz.css" stylesheet.
     - Replace the default logo image with your own branding.
     - Optionally, modify or exclude visual effects based on your preferences.

This JavaScript code is designed to create a simple quiz game. It consists of various functions and features to facilitate the game. Below is a brief overview of its functionality:

1. Question Data: The code begins with an array named `questions`, which contains individual question objects. Each object comprises a question statement, answer options, and the index of the correct answer.

2. Game State Variables: The code maintains several variables, including `currentQuestions`, `currentQuestionIndex`, and `playerScore`, which keep track of the game's progress.

3. DOM Elements: The code selects and stores relevant HTML elements using variables such as `questionElement`, `optionsElement`, and `scoreElement` to interact with the user interface.

4. Shuffling Questions: The `shuffleArray` function shuffles the questions, and the `selectRandomQuestions` function initializes the game by selecting and shuffling five random questions from the `questions` array.

5. Displaying Questions: The `showQuestion` function displays the current question and its answer options on the user interface.

6. Checking Answers: The `checkAnswer` function is called when a player selects an answer. It checks if the selected option is correct, updates the player's score, and provides feedback.

7. Feedback Display: The `displayFeedback` function displays feedback to the player, indicating whether their answer was correct or not.

8. Progressing Through Questions: The game allows players to move to the next question using the "Next" button (controlled by the `nextButton` element).

9. Displaying Celebratory Effects: When the player achieves a perfect score (5 out of 5), the game displays fireworks and balloons as a visual celebration.

10. Showing Final Result: Once all questions are answered, the `showResult` function is called. It hides the questions, displays the result, player's score, and any celebratory effects if applicable.

11. Updating Player Score: The `updateScore` function is responsible for updating the player's score in the UI.

12. Player Information Display: The `showPlayerInfo` function displays information about the player (a placeholder "user" object is used to hold player information).

13. Sending Score to a Python Server: The `sendScoreToPython` function makes a POST request to a Python server endpoint ("/receive-score") with the player's score as JSON data and logs the response from the server.

14. Game Initialization: The code calls `showQuestion` to start the game by displaying the first question.
